# Overview

This is a simple console-based **Task Manager** application written in Kotlin.

As a software engineer, I built this project to strengthen my knowledge of Kotlinâ€™s syntax and key programming concepts. It helped me practice object-oriented programming using classes and data classes, manage collections using mutable lists, and implement user input with conditionals and loops.

The application allows users to:
- Add a task with a title and description
- View all tasks
- Remove a task by its index

These actions are handled through a simple command-line menu interface.

# Future Work

- Add due dates and task priority
- Save tasks to a local file or database

- Use enums for task status (e.g., TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)
- Add command-line arguments for automation or batch operations
